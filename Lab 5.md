**Lab 5**

Lab 5 in the CMTH 642 course at Ryerson University was designed to teach aspiring data scientist how to create and use the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. It is used to assess whether the distributions of the observations between two separate groups on a dependent variable are different from one another. It replaces the obtained values with a rank score, then test how likely the sum of the ranks occurs by chance from the same population.



To begin I would recommend reading the PDF file that explains each question and why it is done.
